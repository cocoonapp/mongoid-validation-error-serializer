# mongoid-validation-error-serializer
Ruby module to serialize errors for Mongoid models in Rails. Probably also works in non-Rails projects using Mongoid.

## Usage
Just add in your Rails project in `lib/` or for instance as a controller concern in `app/controllers/concerns`.

## Warranty
There's no warranty here. It suits our needs, and it might suit yours too. I don't have any plans to maintain this. See the test file for any idea how this should work. I didn't add the factories refered in the start of the test file, so it won't work out of the box.
